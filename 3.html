            <p>The long path of sending you off
                I’m still standing there
                Watching the season you love
                Come and go
                
                You don’t need to try at all
                When things get too much
                You can forget my name any time
                
                When the flowers spread
                A new spring will come to you too
                Even if it takes time
                Please be happy
                
                The next words
                I cannot tell you
                So I’ll keep them in my heart
                
                When the flowers spread
                A new spring will come regardless
                Even if it takes a while
                Please be happy
                
                Snowflakes are falling
                Are you watching?
                Our season that was so cold that it was sad
                It’s passing by
                
                Can’t you think of me once more
                For the last time?
                I want us to have the same hearts once again
                Before I let us go
                
                Days I loved you so much
                Forever, I’ll be here</p>            
        </body>
